# Methods

To see a list of methods on an object, enter the objects name followed by a '.' and then the tab key.

To get help on a specific method, select it from the list and then press shift followed by tab. Alternatively wrap the statement in parenthesis preceded by the keyword help. Eg., `help(mylist.insert)`. The third alteranative is the online Python documentation at [https://docs.python.org/3/]

## What are methods

Essentially functions built into Python objects.

## Syntax

```Python
object.method(arg1, arg2...)
```

## JavaScript

Ref course notes for extensive use of methods in JavaScript in the same way that Python offers.
