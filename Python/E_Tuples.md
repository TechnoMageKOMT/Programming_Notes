# Tuples

## Definition

Tuples are very similar to list. They are, however, immutable. Tuples use parenthesis, (), instead of []. Example (1,2,3).

## len() method

Same as lists

## Mixed data types

Allowed just like lists

## Slicing and Indexing

Works just like lists

## .count() method

Returns the number of times that the argument appears in the tuple.

```Python
some_tuple = ('a', 'a', 'b')
some_tuple.count('a')
Return: 2
```

## .index() method

Returns the index number of the first appearance  of the argument.

```Python
some_tuple = ('a', 'a', 'b')
some_tuple.index('a')
Return: 0
```
