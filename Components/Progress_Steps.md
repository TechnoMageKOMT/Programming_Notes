# Progress Steps

## HTML

Start again with an outer div container with class **container**.

Within that another container with class **progress-container**.

Within that a div with *class and id* of **progress** (no content this is just for styling and for creating the progress line that will connect the different steps).

On the same level the circle div's will follow with a class of **circle** (the first one will also have the active class). These will all have the numbers 1 through 4 as content.

Outside of this but on the same level as the progress-container div, the button's will be placed. The first button will have a *class* of **btn** and *id* of **prev**. It will also have the **disabled attribute** set (this is because it should not be selectable at the very beginning of the process.). The second button will be identical but have a **next**. *id* and the disabled attribute removed. Both will also have the inner text corresponding to their ids.
