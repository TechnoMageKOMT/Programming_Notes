## Day 1 Expanding Cards

Basically a parent div with 5 children div's which will form the interactive cards.

The first child div will have a class of 'panel' and 'active'. This active class is going to be toggled based on the active card. The rest start out with classes 'panel' only 

Each card also has Some 'h3' text with a background image. They are using inline styling. I will rather use an additional class and do this on the stylesheet.
