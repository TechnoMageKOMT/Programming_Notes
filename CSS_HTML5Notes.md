## Day 1 Expanding Cards

Basically a container wrapped around 5 div's which will be the interactive panels.

The first inner div's will have a class of 'panel' and 'active'. This active class is going to be toggled based on the active card.

Each card also has Some 'h3' text with a background image. They are using inline styling. I will rather use an additional class and do this on the stylesheet.
