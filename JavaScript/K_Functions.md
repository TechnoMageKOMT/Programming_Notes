# Functions

## Definitions

Functions are code on demand.  

Variables and constants created in functions "belong" to that function.  

Functions MAY take parameters (arguments) and MAY return a value.  

Functions can be called multiple times (with different arguments).  

Functions can be called "directly" or "indirectly". Directly when using () and indirectly when binding a function to an event listener.  

## Objects

Functions are objects themselves and everything that applies to objects apply to them. They are stored in the 'Heap" for example just like any other objects.

## Declaration vs Expression
