# Arrays

## .forEach() Method

The forEach() method loops over an array. It takes a single argument and that is a call back function.

The callback function takes two optional arguments of its own. The first is the item itself and the second is the index of the item.

```JavaScript
array.forEach(function(item, index){
  //Code that will be executed on each element in the array
})
```
