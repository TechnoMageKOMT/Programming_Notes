# Refactoring of Code

The process of restructuring code without affecting its external behaviour.

- Create seperate file for all functions **NB** Should be linked above the normal script.js in the index.html file
- Try and abstract as many functionalities to function calls.
- Look out for duplicated code and replace such code blocks with functions

The priority of refactoring:

1. Readability
2. Modularity (re-usability of code)
3. Efficiency (how fast code runs)
4. :ength
