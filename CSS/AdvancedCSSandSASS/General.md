# Advanced CSS and SASS - General Notes

Asign a class to every single element in the HTML.

Set general font properties, including line height, color in the body{} section of the CSS because font properties are usually inherited.

To set a white border around the entire website add padding to the body{}.

## clip-path property

Clips an element to a basic shape or to a SVG source. Ref: [https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/] for a tool to create various different shapes. A link for this tool is also available on Jonas' resources page [http://codingheroes.io/resources/]
